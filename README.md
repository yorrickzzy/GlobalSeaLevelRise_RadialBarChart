# GlobalSeaLevelRise_RadialBarChart
This interactive radial bar chart visualizes global sea level differences (in mm) from 1921 to 2022. Each bar represents a year, with its length corresponding to the sea level difference. A dropdown menu lets users select a specific time range (1921-1940, 1941-1960, 1961-1980, 1981-2000, 2001-2022), updating the chart accordingly. The chart also features a "Play" button for automatic cycling through time ranges every 2 seconds and a "Pause" button for manual selection. Reference circles around the chart indicate sea level values (e.g., -140 mm, -100 mm).

#tips: To run this code, ensure that all files are in the same directory and execute the GlobalSeaLevelRise_RadialBarChart.html file. Since this code involves loading CSV files, it may encounter a “cross-origin request” issue in certain browsers, such as Google Chrome. To resolve this, you can either use Mozilla Firefox to open the file or install the Live Server extension in Visual Studio Code and launch the project using Live Server.
