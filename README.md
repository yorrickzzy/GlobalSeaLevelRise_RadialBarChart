# GlobalSeaLevelRise_RadialBarChart
This interactive radial bar chart visualizes global sea level differences (in mm) from 1921 to 2022. Each bar represents a year, with its length corresponding to the sea level difference. A dropdown menu lets users select a specific time range (1921-1940, 1941-1960, 1961-1980, 1981-2000, 2001-2022), updating the chart accordingly. The chart also features a "Play" button for automatic cycling through time ranges every 2 seconds and a "Pause" button for manual selection. Reference circles around the chart indicate sea level values (e.g., -140 mm, -100 mm).
